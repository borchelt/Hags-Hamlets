#Roles

Bryan Exley - Bryan worked primarily on gathering Ascii assets,
	      developing monsters, items, npcs and dialogue sequences.
	      Bryan had a huge hand in the narrative elements of the game,
	      and wrote a fair potion of all of the descriptive elements.
	      Bryan worked on the introduction and the tutorial. He also 
	      spent a great portion of time describing the enemies and locations.
	      Bryan wrote the dialogue interaction system, the containers,
	      and the core randomizer elements of the game which make it
	      a roguelike. 

Wolfgang Borchelt- Wolfgang wrote an amazing amount of code in a short time. 
		   Being on a completely opposite schedule of Bryan worked out
		   nicely. Wolgang worked late hours adjusting the framework of
		   the game, organizing the chaos into a cohesive whole. Wolfgang
		   wrote the console controls and backbone of the game. The various
		   classes were the result of his engineering. He wrote the functions
		   that controlled combat and navigation, worked the trade give/get 
	 	   and quest systems. In short, the reason this game is interactive 
		   is because of Wolfgang. Additionally, he wrote some killer music
		   and developed sounds that really amplify (pun intended) the mood
		   of this project.
